# Advent of Code 2022

This repo tracks my advent of code solutions for 2022, each days work in contained it's own folder. 
See: [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) 

*NB: Not flowing with the days, I try or tried to do as much as I can (Whenever you are looking at this, it may be in the year when 2122 I would be gone but know that I TRIED)*

## How it went?

I have been adding my experience for each day in my commits, decided it would be more fun to also put those here:

### Day 4

    Day 4 solution part 1

    This took me longer than expected, I think a good 3
    hours spread across 2 days.

    WHY? I was looking fully contained section assigments
    across all group assignments.

    The problem grouped the assignments in parts and the check
    was only supposed be for each pair and not across pairs (my bad!).

### Day 3

```
commit b50cf16f8221196643372b1110fee2bf77c0b31f

    Day 3 solution part 2

    I am suprised part 2 was little disconnected from part 1.
    I mean, I was not able to simply continue with the work already
    done in part 1, weird.
