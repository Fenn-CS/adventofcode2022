# Advent of Code 2022

This repo tracks my advent of code solutions for 2022, each days work in contained it's own folder. 
See: [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) 

*NB: Not flowing with the days, I try or tried to do as much as I can (Whenever you are looking at this, it may be in the year when 2122 I would be gone but know that I TRIED)*

## How it went?

I have been adding my experience for each day in my commits, decided it would be more fun to also put those here:

### Day 6

```
commit 732bf8b3c0b756329a283a1cc8dac3f5d8d3ca5f (HEAD -> master)
Author: Fon E. Noel NFEBE <fenn25.fn@gmail.com>

    Day 6 solution part 2

    Simply added a generalized fucntion which does same thing
    as in part 1 using a different parameter (14 in this case)

    Day 6 solution part 1

    This is pretty straight forward, my alogorithm needs to be
    stress-tested to see how it perfoms when the stream is too large
    and the packet market is burried right within.

### Day 5

```
commit d08fb976d0e7ac0f8cc69616520406dff97be30b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Fon E. Noel NFEBE <fenn25.fn@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 9 01:03:53 2022 +0100

    Day 5 solution part 2

    Well not so hard given part 1 was already done.

    However, this is probably not efficient and VERY WET!

    If my colleage [Liam](https://github.com/liam-lloyd) were
    to look at this code he would have lot of ideas on how I could
    make things DRY like he does with my code at work :).

    Well, sorry Liam and DRY-code warriors, day 5 was long overdue.

    See you day 6.

commit 46c22b0b6927cb40a7071285de24d2ecde17cf8b (HEAD -> master)

    Day 5 solution part 1

    Actual solution for day5 part 1.

    This is the first problem where I needed to run the test set
    on my code to get the actual input right!

    Maybe the lesson for day 5 is, ALWAYS RUN THE TEST SET.

    - It helps me realize whether I captured the inputs in a way that
    works for that example and in future for the inputs
    - Let's you know if the algorithm works quickly

    CONFESSION : I don't write down any algorithm, I just start coding.

    Guess, I am learning the hard way, I am not that smart. Time to start
    writing my psedu code down before attempting code???

    CRAY! : Input formatting day 5! ðŸ™„

    For day 5, I really wonder if the aim was for the actual
    issue was for the elves to receive any help.

    I mean, they really don't deserve it! Their input was poor
    and terrible.

    Shamefully, I spent about four hours over 2 days trying to
    get the input in a sane way for me to use.

    It's still terrible but it works!

### Day 4

    Day 4 solution part 2

    Some more thought could be put into this, I believe
    generating ranges makes the algorithm significantly slower.

    However, given how much time I spent on part 1 of this problem
    in 211b0b7626e27c810cf3f7696fb57fc2b9f7c2ab I just want to get past day 4.

    Mind you, it's day 7.

    Day 4 solution part 1

    This took me longer than expected, I think a good 3
    hours spread across 2 days.

    WHY? I was looking fully contained section assigments
    across all group assignments.

    The problem grouped the assignments in parts and the check
    was only supposed be for each pair and not across pairs (my bad!).

### Day 3

```
commit b50cf16f8221196643372b1110fee2bf77c0b31f
Author: Fon E. Noel NFEBE <fenn25.fn@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 6 00:34:51 2022 +0100

    Day 3 solution part 2

    I am suprised part 2 was little disconnected from part 1.
    I mean, I was not able to simply continue with the work already
    done in part 1, weird.

    Day 3 solution part 1

    Felt more straight-forward than day2
